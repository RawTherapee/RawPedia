The graduated filter tool simulates a real neutral density graduated
filter. These can be used used in for example landscape photography to
limit the brightness of the sky. It applies an exposure adjustment in
the form of a gradient.

## Strength

The strength of the filter, in stops.

## Angle

The angle slider allows to rotate the direction in which gradient is
applied.

## Feather

The feather slider controls the width of the filter’s feather
(gradient). At 0 there is no feathering, just a sharp edge which can be
useful as a temporary setting when choosing position and angle of the
filter. The slider value (0 - 100) specifies the width of the feather as
percent of the image diagonal.

## Center X and Center Y

The Center X and Center Y adjustments moves the center of the filter’s
feather (ie the rotation anchor point) horizontally and vertically
respectively.
