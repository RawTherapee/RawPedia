This article will enable you to use RawTherapee more efficiently and to
take full advantage of features which even an experienced user may not
know about. Take a few minutes to read it.

## Panels

The Editor tab has three main panels whose visibility can be toggled
using the Show/Hide Panel buttons
![<File:Panel-to-bottom.png>](/images/Panel-to-bottom.png "File:Panel-to-bottom.png")
![<File:Panel-to-left.png>](/images/Panel-to-left.png "File:Panel-to-left.png")
![<File:Panel-to-top.png>](/images/Panel-to-top.png "File:Panel-to-top.png")
![<File:Panel-to-right.png>](/images/Panel-to-right.png "File:Panel-to-right.png"),
making more room for the image preview.

You can use the mouse scrollwheel to safely scroll the panels up/down
without accidentally changing a slider, because RawTherapee requires
that you hold the Shift key while using the mouse scrollwheel if your
intention is to manipulate a slider or cycle through the options in a
drop-down menu (called a "combobox").

## Tools

There are many tools, vertical screen space is limited and scrolling
takes time. You can right-click a tool's title to expand that tool and
collapse all other tools in the same tab. This allows you to make the
most of the available vertical screen space and to reduce the need for
scrolling.

Most tools have a power button to the left of their title which lets you
turn that tool on or off. The power button can also have an
"inconsistent" state if you select two or more photos in the [File Browser](file_browser) and a given tool is turned on in some
of the selected photos but off in others. Some tools instead of an
on/off button have an "expander" which lets you expand or collapse the
contents of that tool.

![<File:Power-off-small.png>](/images/Power-off-small.png "File:Power-off-small.png")
Off.

![<File:Power-on-small.png>](/images/Power-on-small.png "File:Power-on-small.png")
On.

![<File:Power-inconsistent-small.png>](/images/Power-inconsistent-small.png "File:Power-inconsistent-small.png")
Inconsistent.

![<File:Expander-closed-small.png>](/images/Expander-closed-small.png "File:Expander-closed-small.png")
Collapsed.

![<File:Expander-open-small.png>](/images/Expander-open-small.png "File:Expander-open-small.png")
Expanded.

## Sliders

To adjust a slider, hover the mouse over it and hold the key while
scrolling the scrollwheel up/down. Using the mouse scrollwheel without
the key scrolls the panel up/down.

Each slider has a fine-tuning mode which reduces the effect of the
mouse, allowing you to make very fine adjustments which would otherwise
be difficult to make. You will enter fine-tuning mode if you
click-and-hold the slider's adjustment knob for 1 second without moving
it. You can also enter or leave fine-tuning mode if you press the key
while holding the knob. This is a standard feature of all programs which
use [GTK+ 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK+).

Each slider has a "reset" button
![<File:Undo-small.png>](/images/Undo-small.png "File:Undo-small.png") which
behaves as follows:

- resets the slider to the default value, which is hard-coded to 0 for
  most sliders or to some other value when 0 wouldn't be appropriate.

- \+ resets the slider to the value it had initially when you opened
  that photo.

## Curves

RawTherapee has three kinds of curve widgets:

- Tone curves
- Equalizer curves
- Threshold curves

<div align="center">

<File:Rt55> curve type tone.png\|The tone curve. <File:Rt55> curve type
equalizer.png\|The equalizer curve <File:Rt55> curve type
threshold.png\|The threshold curve.

</div>

\[\[<File:Rt55> curves.png\|frame\|1- Curve type.

2- Curve mode.\]\]

The shape of a tone curve and of an equalizer curve is defined based on
control points which you create and position with the mouse. When a
curve is linear, that means that the input matches the output, and so
the curve has no effect. When a curve is not linear, it has an effect on
the image.

A curve is plotted based on the control points which you create and
position. The same control points can lead to different curve shapes by
changing the underlying math, and you can control this math by choosing
a tone curve type in the drop-down list:

- ![<File:curve-linear-small.png>](curve-linear-small.png "File:curve-linear-small.png")
  Linear,
- ![<File:curve-spline-small.png>](curve-spline-small.png "File:curve-spline-small.png")
  Standard,
- ![<File:curve-catmullrom-small.png>](curve-catmullrom-small.png "File:curve-catmullrom-small.png")
  Flexible,
- ![<File:curve-parametric-small.png>](curve-parametric-small.png "File:curve-parametric-small.png")
  Parametric,
- ![<File:curve-nurbs-small.png>](curve-nurbs-small.png "File:curve-nurbs-small.png")
  Control cage.

You can also click the curve type button to toggle the visibility of the
curve. This allows you to make the most of the limited vertical screen
space. If a curve is not linear and the tool within which it lies is
enabled, then that curve has an effect on the image regardless whether
it is visible or not.

Each curve can be reset
![<File:Undo-small.png>](/images/Undo-small.png "File:Undo-small.png") to the
default value. Some curves come in groups, such as the [Lab Adjustments](lab_adjustments) curves. There is one reset
button for the whole group, and it applies to the currently selected
curve. Click on the curve type drop-down button to select that curve.

Some curves have a color picker
![<File:Crosshair-node-curve.png>](/images/Crosshair-node-curve.png "File:Crosshair-node-curve.png")
and a control point in/out value editor
![<File:Edit-point.png>](/images/Edit-point.png "File:Edit-point.png").

### Color Picker

<figure>
<img src="/images/Rt55_lab_hh_color_picker.png"
title="Rt55_lab_hh_color_picker.png" />
<figcaption>Rt55_lab_hh_color_picker.png</figcaption>
</figure>

Most curves in RawTherapee have a color picker button
![<File:Crosshair-node-curve.png>](/images/Crosshair-node-curve.png "File:Crosshair-node-curve.png").
The color picker enables you to place a control point in a curve at the
exact spot which corresponds to the area you're hovering over on the
preview.

Let's say you want to change the hue of a purple flower, to make it more
blue. Without the color picker, you would have to guess the exact spot
on the curve which corresponds hue of the flower, else the affected
range of hues would be too wide and you might end up changing hues you
did not want to change. Using the color picker you simply click on the
flower and a control point appears on the curve which corresponds to
that exact hue. You can adjust that control point as needed.

When the color picker button is clicked, the color picker is activated
for the currently selected curve. Now when you hover the cursor over the
preview you will notice that a vertical or horizontal line appears in
the selected curve. This line represents the value of the pixel you're
hovering over. To place a control point in the curve for the value
you're hovering over, + the preview - a control point will appear in the
curve. You can adjust that control point without leaving the preview
area, just keep holding the left mouse button after you place the
control point, and moving the mouse up and down moves the control point
up and down in the curve. Holding while editing a control point
decreases your mouse speed so that you can very finely adjust that
point. You will usually not require this precision, so after adding a
new control point via +, let go of but keep holding the left mouse
button.

To deactivate the color picker, either anywhere in the preview area or
on the same color picker button again.

You do not need to deactivate the previous curve's color picker to use
it on a new curve, just activate it as usual, and the old one
automatically deactivates.

#### Control Point In/Out Values

Each curve has a button which lets you edit the selected control point's
in/out values. You can use this tool, for example, to match a control
point's "out" value on a photo of a color target to a reference value.

The tool works with control points, and the most likely way you will
create these control points is by using the color picker. For this
example, we will start with a curve without any control points and
create some using the color picker. Click the control point in/out value
editor button
![<File:Edit-point.png>](/images/Edit-point.png "File:Edit-point.png") next to
the curve, and also click the color picker button
![<File:Crosshair-node-curve.png>](/images/Crosshair-node-curve.png "File:Crosshair-node-curve.png").
You will now see "I" (in) and "O" (out) values displayed under the
curve. They correspond to the point under the mouse cursor if you hover
it over the curve or over the preview. Hover the cursor over the
preview. Since you activated the color picker, you can + a spot in the
preview to place a control point in the curve which corresponds to that
spot's value (whatever that value may be - for example for the L\* curve
the value is the lightness of the pixel under the cursor, for the RGB
red curve it's the red value in the RGB space in the working profile).
Do that, + on a spot in the preview. A control point appears in the
curve. To edit the control point's in/out values, right-click on the
control point. It turns red with a red ring around it. Now you can edit
the in/out values and see the control point move in real-time. To go out
of control point editing mode once you are done editing, either
right-click anywhere inside the curve area other than on that control
point, or just click the control point value editor button again to
deactivate it.

### Tone Curves

![](/images/Rt55_curve_linear.png "Rt55_curve_linear.png")
![](/images/Rt55_curve_standard.png "Rt55_curve_standard.png")
![](/images/Rt55_curve_flexible.png "Rt55_curve_flexible.png")
![](/images/Rt55_curve_parametric.png "Rt55_curve_parametric.png")
![](/images/Rt55_curve_control_cage.png "Rt55_curve_control_cage.png")

Tone curves serve to map an input value (on the horizontal or X axis) to
an output value (on the vertical or Y axis). Though they may seem
intimidating at first, after a little playing you will quickly develop
an intuitive understanding. Curves can do everything "levels" can do and
much more, so the sooner you grasp how they work the better.

As an example, look at the "Standard curve" (screenshot to the right) in
the [Exposure](exposure) tool. There are grid lines in the
background at every 10% interval. The left end of the horizontal (input)
axis represents pure black, then the shadows, then the mid-tones, then
the highlights, and finally the right end represents pure white.
Likewise, the vertical (output) axis represents pure black at the
bottom, pure white at the top, and the same graduation between the two.
If the curve is linear, i.e. a diagonal straight line from bottom-left
to top-right, then the curve has no effect – every point on the curve
has an output value identical to its input value. For the curve to have
an effect, the line must be non-linear so some point's output value does
not match its input value. The *control points* you place on the curve
are there just to help you control the curve, they do not matter in the
calculations – what matters is the *curve's* shape. In the example
screenshot, a control point in the bottom-left part pushes the curve
down: the control point lies at 10% on the "input" axis, but at only 5%
of the output axis – this causes dark tones to be made even darker. The
next control point lies at 40% on the input axis and 60% on the output
axis - those mid-tones will be made brighter. Since only the curve's
shape matters, even though there are no more control points in this
example, the curve at input=60% has output=95%, which means that the
bright areas will be made very bright, almost white. The curve at
input=20% also has output=20%, so those dark tones won't change between
the input and output.

There are multiple types of curves at your disposal:

- **Linear**


The default type - a straight line that results in no change to input
values. The mathematically inclined may observe that it is a graph of
y=x. The rest of us just set the control to linear to “turn off” the
curve.

- **Standard**


The type most commonly seen in other software. Click to drop a control
point anywhere on the curve and then drag the control point to change
the curve's shape. The top-right point represents the brightest areas in
the photo. Drag that point vertically down to make the highlights less
bright; move it horizontally to the left to make bright areas brighter,
perhaps at the cost of some overexposure. The bottom-left point
represents the darkest areas in the photo. Move that point horizontally
to the right to make the photo darker, perhaps at the cost of some
underexposure. Move it vertically up to make the darks lighter.

- **Flexible**


A characteristic of the "Standard" cubic spline curve is that editing
one node could have a huge impact on what happens to the curve in
relation to the other nodes. The "Flexible" centripetal Catmull–Rom
spline curve allows you to make adjustments to any part of the curve
with little impact on the other parts.

- **Parametric**


Allows you to use sliders rather than dragging the curve directly. For
the Parametric curve type, clicking the right mouse button over the zone
selector
(![Image:Parametric_curve_bar.png](/images/Parametric_curve_bar.png "Image:Parametric_curve_bar.png"))
will reset the handles' position to their default values. (The global
reset button will reset them too.)

- **Control Cage**


At first sight this curve type looks very much like the Custom curve,
but there are some differences. With the Custom curve, the curve touches
all the control points. This is not the case with the control cage curve
– the control points attract the curve towards them but the curve
doesn’t actually go through them. Another difference is that the control
cage allows for a straight section of the curve, while you can't do this
with the custom curve. The cage curve needs at least three points for
that (so five in total). Holding down the Shift key while dragging a
point will help you to easily create a straight line by snapping the
point to the line made by the previous and next point (displayed in red
by the 'snap to' tool). Many users prefer Control Cage type curves to
the alternatives.

### The Flat Curve

[frame](/images/flat_curve_justcurve.png) A number of tools in
RawTherapee use the *flat curve*:

- [Lab Adjustments](lab_adjustments)
  - [LH](lab_adjustments#lh_curve)
  - [CH](lab_adjustments#ch_curve)
  - [HH](lab_adjustments#hh_curve)
- [Defringe](defringe)
  - [Hue](defringe#hue)
- [HSV Equalizer](hsv_equalizer)
  - [H](hsv_equalizer#h)
  - [S](hsv_equalizer#s)
  - [V](hsv_equalizer#v)

It's very simple to use once you understand it, so let's use the [HSV Equalizer](hsv_equalizer) in the
![<File:Color-circles.png>](/images/Color-circles.png "File:Color-circles.png")
Color tab as an example. Click on the drop-down icon
[image:Drop-down.png](/images/drop-down.png) next to the H(ue)
button and choose "*Minima/Maxima control points*"
![<File:Curve-controlpoints-small.png>](/images/Curve-controlpoints-small.png "File:Curve-controlpoints-small.png").
You'll see six dots on the horizontal line in the middle and six
vertical lines that cross these dots. Notice that those lines are
colored; from left to right: red, yellow, green, aqua, blue and magenta.
Now click on the very left dot (the cursor changes into a little hand)
and move it slightly upward and downward. Result: red colors quickly
change to green, blue and magenta as the cursor is moved up, and to
pink, blue and green when moved down.

Notice that a new horizontal line appears when you start dragging a
color point, and see how its color changes. The vertical axis represents
input colors, and the horizontal axis output colors.

When you click and drag a vertical line (the line, not the point!), the
very first movement will determine the kind of move: vertical or
horizontal (so take care with this first movement if you want to have a
predictable result). If you want to move the point in both directions at
the same time, then click and drag the point itself. To move the point
only in one direction (only horizontally or only vertically) you can use
the 'snap to' function by holding down the Shift key while moving the
point.

[frame](/images/flat_curve_zoom.png) It's easy to see if a
point is on its neutral value (i.e. on the middle line) because the
color of the point will be green. As soon as you move a point off its
neutral value, it changes color to black.

The [HSV Equalizer](hsv_equalizer) wraps around on the
horizontal axis, so the very right vertical line equals the very left
line. You can see this by dragging the red line on the left side a bit
to the left. Now the left point of the graph is at the same position as
the very right point. Holding the **Shift** key while dragging a point
prevents it from wrapping around the horizontal axis, which can be
useful in preventing accidental curve steps in hard-to-see places at the
edges.

You can delete points by dragging them out of the editor field. You can
add points by clicking somewhere on the curve. When you place the mouse
on one of the points, you see a yellow and blue indicator. Place the
mouse on the yellow one and the cursor changes into a left arrow. Now
you can drag this point to the left, to change the slope of the curve.
Ditto for the blue indicator.

To get an idea how this editor works, delete all but two colors (e.g.
red and yellow) and move the graph around, change its slope and see what
happens to your photo.

Reset the *Hue* curve to "*Linear*" (no changes) by clicking on the
reset icon ![image:Gtk-undo-ltr.png](/images/gtk-undo-ltr.png)
next to the *Value* button. To compare the effects of the *Hue* curve
with linear: switch between "*Linear*" and "*Minima/Maxima control
points*" in the drop-down menu next to this button, or use the history
list on the left side of your screen.

You can save a curve for later use by clicking on the disk button. Note
that only the actual (shown) H, S or V curve is saved, not all three at
once, so don't give your curve a name like my_hsv because it doesn't
describe whether the curve inside it is H, S or V, but instead name your
saved curve files something like my_hue, my_sat and my_val. The
extension will be added automatically, "*.rtc*".

### Threshold Curves

Threshold Curves are the simplest. They are used to tell a RawTherapee
tool the tones (or hues or saturations values) that you want processed
(or processed differently).

As an example, consider the Threshold curve editor on the Detail -\>
[Sharpening](sharpening) tool.
![](/images/Sharpening_Threshold.png "_Sharpening_Threshold.png") The setting
shown is telling the Sharpening tool to phase in sharpening quickly in
the black areas (the steep line up on the left), maintain full
sharpening through mid-tones (the plateau area) and then phase out
sharpening slowly in the highlights (the long slope down). Dragging one
of the control points will move the slope leading up or down from the
point. To just move the point, but not the slope as a whole, hold down
the shift key while you drag.

On the top right is a reset button that will reset back to default.

**Warning:** resetting the curve is considered a curve modification, so
if you've just modified the curve and mistakenly pressed the *Reset*
button, there's no way to bring back your curve. (Ctrl-z will go one
step before in the *History* list, not in the curve's edition). This
comment applies to Tone and Flat Curves as well.

You’ll also find Threshold Curves used in the [Contrast by Detail Levels](contrast_by_detail_levels) and the
[Vibrance](vibrance) tools.

You may have noticed that Threshold Curves actually consist of a few
straight lines rather than a curve. If this bothers you, you might want
to take a break before moving on to Flat Curves.

## The Preview Area

The preview is designed to show you the most realistic result possible,
however one must keep in mind that the larger an image is, the longer it
takes to process. For speed reasons, the preview of the effects of most
tools is calculated not on the full-sized image (which would take
exactly as long as saving the image, making using sliders and curves
impossible), but on the preview image which is of the size of your
preview area. Many tools, such as the [Exposure](exposure)
tool, can be applied to an image of any size, and their effects will be
identical regardless of the size of the image they are applied to.
However some tools are size-dependent, for example all of the tools in
the Detail tab, which means if you apply one of these tools to a
full-sized image and to a smaller version of that image, and then
downscale the full-sized image to the smaller image's size, the two
images won't match. For reasons of speed, RawTherapee must use the small
preview image so that your tool tweaking experience may be fast and
fluid, but this means that the effects of size-dependent tools would not
be accurate when applied to a small zoomed-out preview. We made the
decision to either disable the preview effects of these tools entirely
at zoom levels less than 100%, or to keep the preview effects active but
to warn you that what you see at zoom levels less than 100% may be
inaccurate depending on the tool settings (for example [Tone Mapping](tone_mapping) and [Wavelet](wavelet) may
be accurate at zoom levels less than 100% or they may be inaccurate,
depending on their settings). You will know which tools these are
because they are marked with a "1:1" icon
![<File:One-to-one-small.png>](/images/One-to-one-small.png "File:One-to-one-small.png")
next to their names. RawPedia explains how accurate the preview is for
all affected tools on each tool's page.
