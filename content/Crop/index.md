Crop

</div>

Cropping in RawTherapee does not discard the cropped-off area, it just
hides it by drawing a crop frame and zooming in to fit the frame to the
available screen space. You can still see the cropped-off area in the
preview if you zoom out and set the [background color of the
preview](The_Image_Editor_Tab#Background_color_of_the_preview.md)
to "theme-based". The cropped-off area will of course not appear in the
saved image.

When you set the [background color of the
preview](The_Image_Editor_Tab#Background_color_of_the_preview.md)
to anything other than "theme-based" then the cropped-off area will be
completely hidden from the preview, but if you set it to "theme-based"
then by default the cropped-off area will be covered by a dark but
semi-transparent mask. You can define the color and transparency of this
mask in "[Preferences](preferences) \> General \> [Crop mask
color/transparency](Preferences#Default_Theme.md)".

Activate crop-placing mode by clicking the "Select Crop" button in the
tool panel, the ![<File:Crop.png>](Crop.png "File:Crop.png") button in
the [Editor's](the_image_editor_tab) top toolbar, or the
appropriate [keyboard shortcut](keyboard_shortcuts), then
create the crop by clicking and dragging over the preview with your
mouse. Use the **Shift** key to move (pan) the crop over the image.
Resize a crop by placing the mouse on one of the sides or corners. To
clear the crop, activate crop-placing mode again (via the keyboard
shortcut or either of the buttons mentioned above), and click anywhere
in the preview without dragging. To see only the cropped area, use the
"Fit cropped area to screen" [keyboard
shortcut](Keyboard_Shortcuts.md).

Use *Guide Type* to select popular guides to help you in composition
while cropping, and a horizontal (landscape) or vertical (portrait)
orientation. By default, as of version 4.2.214, RawTherapee
automatically detects and uses the same crop orientation as the
orientation of your image - the "As Image" option.

The PPI value (pixels per inch) does not change any physical property of
the image, it only serves to help you see what physical size the current
crop would print at using that PPI value.

### Custom crop ratio

You can make a custom crop ratio as of RawTherapee 5.1.

1.  Disable "Lock ratio",
2.  Make a crop, use "Width" and "Height" values to define the ratio,
    e.g. to make a crop using a 5:4 ratio set width=5 height=4, or
    width=1280 height=1024.
3.  To resize the crop while maintaining the custom ratio, hold the
    Shift key while dragging the edge or corner of the crop frame with
    the mouse.

### Fixed crop ratio

Use "Lock ratio" to set the crop to a fixed ratio.

3:2  
Classic negatives have this ratio, as do
[APS-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APS-C)
[DSLR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_single-lens_reflex_camera)
cameras.

4:3  
The [Four Thirds
System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Thirds_system).

16:9  
The [1080p](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p) and
[720p](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/720p)
[high-definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_video)
video format, and due to this the most common computer monitor aspect
ratio since 2010.

16:10  
The most popular computer monitor aspect ratio between 2005-2009. Still
popular in tablets.

24:65 XPan  
Hasselblad's medium-format cameras.

1.414 DIN EN ISO 216  
[1.414 DIN EN ISO 216](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_216) is the
standard paper size ratio such as A4, B5, etc.

8.5:11  
The [US Letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_(paper_size)) size.

11:17 - Tabloid  
A common [tabloid newspaper
format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_(newspaper_format)).

45:35 - ePassport  
Guides to help you crop a portrait for a [biometric
passport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometric_passport). Official
measurements do not specify exact ratios, just min/max measurements
within which the eyes and chin-crown distance must lie. The guides
represent the averages of those distances. The first horizontal guide is
for the crown, the second is roughly for the nostrils, the third is for
the chin. "On the photo, the face must be between 29mm and 34mm from the
bottom of the chin to the crown (the top of the head, not the top of the
hair)."
