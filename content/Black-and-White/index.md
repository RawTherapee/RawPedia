<img src="/images/Rt_ba_bw_1.jpg" title="Rt_ba_bw_1.jpg" width="900"
alt="Rt_ba_bw_1.jpg" /> The *Black-and-White* tool gives you great
control over the process of converting a color image into a
black-and-white one.

For black-and-white color toning, see the [Black and White Color
Toning](Lab_Adjustments#Black-and-White_Color_Toning.md) section
described in the [Lab Adjustments](Lab_Adjustments.md) chapter,
[Exposure](Exposure.md) tab.
