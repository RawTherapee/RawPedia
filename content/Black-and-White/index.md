alt="Rt_ba_bw_1.jpg" /> The *Black-and-White* tool gives you great
control over the process of converting a color image into a
black-and-white one.

For black-and-white color toning, see the [Black and White Color Toning](lab_adjustments#black-and-white_color_toning) section
described in the [Lab Adjustments](lab_adjustments) chapter,
[Exposure](exposure) tab.
