## Toolchain Pipeline

### Processing Order

Everything that happens to an image, from the moment you open the file
to the moment it is displayed on screen or saved, takes place in a fixed
order. The data flows from one module to another - this is the toolchain
pipeline. RawTherapee contains four pipelines (one for the main preview,
one for the saved image, one for the thumbnail, and one other that
currently escaped me). The following list shows a simplified order of
operations:

## Colorimetry

### The Importance of CIECAM and L\*a\*b\*

Colorimetry gives rise to a lot of debate but we have to remember that
it is not an exact science. No amount of equations, however complex, can
ensure that the human eye will necessarily be satisfied with an image.

Currently RawTherapee uses the L\*a\*b\* color space and CIECAM02/16 for
chromatic adaptation and work has begun on exploring other color spaces
(Jzazbz) and CAM models, for HDR applications (ZCAM does not work)..

The use of the L\*a\*b\* (or CIELAB) color space does have its
limitations but many of its shortcomings can be successfully mitigated,
at least for SDR applications.

For example:

- One of the most frequent criticisms is that L\*a\*b\* is non-linear
  and that it "distorts" the colors, in particular for blue-violet and
  red-orange. This is certainly true if you simply adjust the image
  using curves or chromaticity sliders. However in RawTherapee, if you
  click on "Avoid color shift" (Munsell correction), nearly 200 LUTs
  will correct these shifts and make the image perfectly linear.
- It is also said that L\*a\*b\* addresses imaginary colors if the
  working profile allows it. This is also true but again, this can be
  compensated in RawTherapee by enabling "Avoid color shift". In this
  case, a relative colorimetric correction is applied to the working
  gamut as follows:
  - It analyzes the image data.
  - If it is within gamut no action is taken.
  - If it is outside gamut,the chroma is reduced and if this is
    insufficient, or if it is close to L=0 or L=100, then L is adjusted.
  - You can also choose the algorithm developed by Emil Martinec
    (gamutmap) which provides XYZ control (absolute or relative).
  - However this should rarely occur if Prophoto is used in the Working
    Profile and is probably not important.
  - If the saturation has been adjusted (chroma, vibrance,…), a Munsell
    correction using nearly 200 LUTs is applied. This will correct any
    color shifts with a high degree of accuracy e.g a red that has
    turned orange because of L\*a\*b\*, will become red again. There
    will still be some errors but they are very small.
  - The Munsell correction is applied in all cases unless none is
    selected.

#### L\*a\*b\*

- L\*a\*b\* is a reversible transformation of XYZ (in simplified terms,
  Y is transformed into L\* using a gamma of 3.0 and a slope of 9.03).
  L\*a\*b\* has more or less the same characteristics in terms of its
  limits (those of the primaries) as XYZ, which serves as a reference
  for the Working Profile and determines the basis of the gamut.
  Therefore L\*a\*b\* and XYZ have essentially the same characteristics
  (exposure range, gamut, etc.). One point however, in many processes
  the values of L\* can be bounded (clipped), to limit artifacts (high
  contrasts, highlights...), but in most cases L\* is unbounded. If we
  ever get to HDR processing, we'll probably have to switch to
  "HDR-Lab". The data is not lost, even for high-dynamic range images
  (\>= 25Ev), but the progression in the highlights is not progressive
  enough when used with monitors capable of displaying luminance values
  in the range of 120 cd/m² and beyond.
- I don’t think that the RGB-\>Lab transformation itself prevents
  complete HDR processing. This is because the calculations are
  generally carried out using ‘float’ or ‘double’ data values (32 or 64
  bits) or using SSE (128 bit - 4x32 or 2x64 bits). The linear part of
  the Lab transform allows shadows with values of 0.005 cd/m2 or less to
  be processed. The parabolic part (gamma = 3.0) limits the distribution
  of data in the highlights allowing them to be reproduced more
  accurately (on suitable monitors) with luminance values above 120
  cd/m2. The XYZ\<=\>Lab conversion leads to hardly any loss of data
  (insignificant due to double conversions) and can be considered as a
  kind of lossless compression. Of course if we want to achieve complete
  HDR processing, it is necessary to ensure that the way the data is
  processed, prior to being sent to the monitor, allows for more
  progression in the highlights. The preferred approach for Rawtherapee
  would be to implement HDR-Lab instead of Lab. But in the meantime I
  have implemented the possibility of changing the gamma of Lab (3.0)
  for several tools (wavelets, tone-mapping, etc.) notably to make it
  linear. It should be noted that Rawtherapee is designed to overcome
  one of the problems with Lab, which is the non-preservation of the hue
  when the saturation changes (especially in oranges and purples), by
  using "Perceptual Uniform Lab". This involves using a series of
  Munsell LUTs, as well as gamut control to prevent virtual colors.

#### L\*a\*b\* does not impact the gamut or the dynamic range of high-dynamic-range images as shown in the following example with a Dynamic Range of 25Ev

Note that the majority of digital cameras in 2024 have a maximum dynamic
range of about 15Ev. This image is therefore exceptional but
demonstrates the behavior of Lab\* for images with a high dynamic range.

###### Original image - 25Ev - unprocessed

Note:

- The shadows lack detail.
- Approximately 40% of the image is 100% white.
- The restored black-to-white dynamic range is around 12 to 13 Ev.

###### Image with Local Adjustments - Log Encoding

Note:

- The shadows and highlights occupy the entire visible range from L=1 to
  L=99.8 (scale 0 – 100).
- The colors appear evenly distributed as a function of luminance. The
  use of L\*a\*b\* does not impact the dynamic range.
- The dynamic range of the blacks, whites and color is restored to 25Ev.
- Note the use of "White distribution = 90".

#### CIECAM02/16

- One criticism of Ciecam02 is that is not able to process high dynamic
  range and wide color gamut images, which is partially true. A number
  of improvements were made by the development team a few years ago to
  mitigate this problem (bearing in mind that a large number of user
  images fall within the sRGB gamut and do not pose a problem). However,
  by using Log Encoding in conjunction with Cam16, or Color appearance
  (Cam16 & JzCzHz), the vast majority of problems can be solved. Of
  course some images will still present problems, in particular with
  highlight reconstruction, but this is not specific to Ciecam. The
  addition of Ciecam16 (Cam16) solves some of these problems.
- Ciecam02/16 is one of the only ways to achieve true colorimetric
  correction because it takes into account human perception and the
  surrounding environment. With Ciecam for example, any adjustments to
  the luminosity and/or the saturation, will take into account the image
  and its environment.

#### White Balance

- White balance is also subject to debate. The Temperature Correlation
  module recently introduced in Rawtherapee is almost mathematically
  (cognitively) perfect. It makes the xyY colors of the image coincide
  with known spectral data. However, on images where the temperature
  deviates a long way from D50, the colorimetry will not be correct
  because there will not be the necessary chromatic adaptation expected
  by our eyes and brain. Ciecam however, can take this into account.

### Importance of the Linear-RGB Model and Colorimetry

The merits of the RGB model, and in particular, the linear RGB model are
frequently cited. It is certainly the best way to carry out “upstream”
processing (demosaicing, white balance, defringing, chromatic aberration
correction, etc.) and anything that can be done in this mode should be.

However, CIELAB and Ciecam02/16 still have their place despite their
shortcomings. As we have seen above, they are both derived from the CIE
XYZ tristimulus values with Ciecam being one of the only ways to achieve
true colorimetric correction.

So what about tone curves?

- Not only are they non-linear but they only provide limited
  colorimetric compensation, if any (with the exception of the
  Perceptual mode, which uses Ciecam02). This is in contrast to the Tone
  Response Curves -TRC- used for output (monitor, TIF etc.).
- The Auto-Matched Tone Curve, which is a copy of the in-camera TRC, is
  applied mid-process and introduces non-linearities in the processing
  pipeline.

What about saturation?

- Maintaining RGB linearity when you change the saturation is not
  impossible but it is difficult and is not implemented in Rawtherapee.
  On the other hand, if you adjust the saturation using Ciecam, it will
  take into account variations in luminance (or brightness) and adapt
  the color accordingly.

In conclusion, RGB, L \*a \*b \*, and Ciecam all have their advantages
and disadvantages. They simply need to be understood so that they can be
used appropriately.

### What are the acceptable principles for processing SDR or HDR images?

The argument below is partly based on the fact that Rawtherapee has two
Ciecam modules, one located at the end of the main process (Color
Appearance & Lighting), the other in Selective Editing, Color Appearance
(Cam16) located just after white balance. These 2 modules are Color
Appearance Models (CAMs) and contain all the processes and tools needed
to ensure good colorimetry. However, these 2 modules alone are not
always able to process: a) images with a very high dynamic range, b)
images with very pronounced shadows, c) images with strong highlights
(not to be confused with highlight reconstruction).

The science of colour matching is often inexact and imprecise.
Nevertheless, as we have seen, the most linear treatment possible seems
to be recommended if practicable. However, this seems impossible if the
differences linked to a) b) c) above are significant. In these cases, I
propose as a first step a principle close to that of the rendering of
human vision: a linear part (slope) to ‘unblock’ the shadows and a
parabolic part (gamma) to render the perception of medium tones and
highlights fairly similar to that of our eye/brain pair. This
linear/parabolic differentiation is commonly used in various software
applications e.g., sRGB gamma where Slope =12.92 and Gamma=2.4, or BT709
where slope=4.5 and Gamma=2.22 or ‘Lab’ where Slope=9.03 and Gamma=3.0.
The two Tone Response Curve (TRC) modules present in the Abstract
Profile module or in Selective Editing \> Color Appearance \> Source
Data Adjustments provide a partial response to the problems described in
a) and b), by allowing adjustments to be carried out with higher Slope
and Gamma values.

The problem of reducing highlights, improving overall contrast and using
local contrast still remains and will be discussed below.

Don't forget that Cam16 is a processing module in its own right. You can
use it to process images using tools such as:

- Surround or Scene conditions ( average, dim, dark etc.) which allows
  you to take dark or very dark backgrounds into account. This algorithm
  alone can provide shadow enhancement in certain images.
- Lightness, Brightness (and their corresponding contrast parameters),
  Chroma, Saturation, Colorfulness, etc.

[Selective Editing - Cam16 and HDR
functions](Local_Adjustments#Using_the_Cam16_and_HDR_functions.md)

As mentioned above, colorimetry is not an exact science so you should
use whichever tools give a result that is pleasing to your eye.

### How useful are ICC and DCP input profiles ?

Raw files are generally decoded using a matrix (from Adobe) called
‘Color Matrix1’ based on the D65 illuminant. This matrix is sufficient
in the vast majority of cases. It can be replaced by either an ICC
profile or a DCP profile that has been developed either by the user,
using a Colorchecker24 for example, or supplied by Rawtherapee or Adobe.
There are two broad problems with these sorts of profiles:

- The Colorchecker24 is limited (with one exception in blues) to the
  sRGB gamut. What happens when such a profile is used, for example, on
  images of flowers or minerals where the gamut is much larger?
- The profile is only really relevant for a given illuminant. What
  happens when a profile developed for D50 (daylight in the sun) is used
  in the shade? It is true that DCP profiles have an interpolation table
  between D65 and Tungsten 2850K, but this is still approximate.

My point is not to say that you shouldn’t use these profiles, which are
very useful for reproducing paintings, coins, etc. in controlled
lighting, but to show their limitations.

### Should I use the Auto-Matched Tone Curve?

The answer is: maybe? This curve generated from the JPEG attached to the
Raw reproduces the colourimetry of the camera manufacturer (Canon,
Nikon, Sony, etc.). This is a criterion of choice, but it has a few
constraints:

- The generated curve can lead to an increase in contrast which,
  depending on the image, may cause clipping in the shadows and
  highlights. In many cases, this increase in contrast is undesirable.
- The default choice of ‘Film-like’ modifies the colorimetry. This
  modification contradicts the underlying philosophy of Ciecam. If you
  want to keep the Auto-Matched Tone Curve, it is better to use the
  Standard mode.

### Should I use the Exposure module, and in particular ‘Exposure compensation’?

The answer is: with reservations. In the case of images of type a), b)
or c), the Exposure slider will bring about a linear change in exposure
(in Ev), increasing (or reducing) shadows and highlights in the same
way. The ‘Highlight compression’ and Blacks sliders can be used to
mitigate this but the adjustment is not very intuitive and can conflict
with the TRC Gamma/Slope adjustments. An alternative is to use the Tone
Equalizer (in the main menu or in Selective Editing), which allows
progressive differentiation of highlights and shadows.

### Tone-mapping modules - description and use

I'll only focus on the modules using Black Ev, White Ev and ‘Mean
Luminance (Yb%) Scene’. For the other Rawtherapee tone mapping modules
are concerned:

- Tone Mapping is more a module for significantly modifying the local
  contrast (texture) than for carrying out a true tone mapping.
- Dynamic Range Compression uses a Laplacian and a Fourier transform.
  Its performance is OK, but it is slow and consumes a lot of resources.
- Note that most images - even with modern cameras - are limited to 14
  or 15 Ev. HDR software that produces a DNG image from several
  bracketed images should be able to reach around 20 Ev.

[An evaluation of the dynamic-range capabilities of tools in
Selective_Editing](Local_Adjustments#An_evaluation_of_the_dynamic-range_capabilities_of_tools_in_Selective_Editing.md)

#### The principle of calculating Dynamic Range (DR)

Three algorithms use the concepts associated with Dynamic Range i.e.
Black Ev, White Ev and ‘Mean Luminance (Yb) scene’ (a concept close to
that of middle grey).

- Log Encoding ;
- Sigmoid;
- Gamma-based and Slope-based highlight roll-off (my favourite).

How are these values assessed? It's a difficult exercise, because it
involves finding the blackest point (black point), the whitest point
(white point) and the average grey value (Yb%) on an unprocessed image.
We use a fairly empirical and approximate formula evaluates these 3 data
points, which are then used by the 3 algorithms mentioned.

- The first question is: ‘What data are we using and at what stage in
  the processing pipeline? Rawtherapee uses the data just after white
  balance and after conversion to the Working Profile (except for
  Sigmoid Q and Slope-based Q which are incorporated into the Cam16
  process).
- The second question is: ‘Are these values representative of reality?
  It’s not sure because in particular:
  - We don't know how the blacks near the black point and whites near
    the white point are mapped,
  - The value of middle grey is, on the one hand, marred by
    approximations and on the other, Ciecam takes into account the
    luminance of the background Yb%, and not the luminance of the whole
    image.
  - Rather than playing empirically with the 3 parameters Black Ev,
    White Ev, ‘Mean luminance (Yb%) Scene’ , this led me to base the
    action on the distribution of blacks and whites, this action having
    an effect on the value of ‘Mean Luminance (Yb%) Scene’. By default,
    ‘White distribution’ is set to 20 to take account of Ciecam (Yb%).

#### How do we use the three values of Black Ev, White Ev and ‘Mean luminance (Yb %) Scene’.?

- Log Encoding calculates a logarithmic base from the Black Ev scene
  value, the dynamic range and the ‘Mean Luminance (Yb%)’ viewing value.
  This logarithmic conversion is applied to all the data to be
  processed. It seems clear that the processing here is anything but
  linear. Depending on the image, the result will sometimes be an excess
  of shadow enhancement and highlight attenuation compared to the
  average highlights. In addition, this conversion can profoundly modify
  the colorimetry. For Log Encoding, the algorithm in Rawtherapee only
  allows simple colour corrections (saturation, brightness compression).
  The advantage of this algorithm is that it can handle a very high
  dynamic range.
- Sigmoid, as its name suggests, uses a mathematical sigmoid based on 3
  main concepts: a) an asymptotic attenuation (especially for whites)
  giving highlights a more natural appearance; b) a variable slope of
  the sigmoid acurve cting on overall contrast; c) a shift (skew) of the
  sigmoid so that the action is primarily on highlights or shadows (you
  can't have both). The advantage of this algorithm is its apparent
  simplicity, and it works very well on images that are not too
  difficult.
  - Simulation: I'm attaching a demonstration of a Sigmoid curve with 2
    parameters where ‘L’ corresponds to ‘Contrast’ and ‘t’ corresponds
    to ‘Skew’. Note that the calculation performed in the code is
    slightly different. This simulation is for demonstration purposes
    only.
  - <https://www.desmos.com/calculator/g382ci99gu?lang=fr>
- The Gamma-based and Slope-based functions both use Freeman's
  tone-mapping algorithm. Gamma-based only uses the asymptotic function
  to give highlights a more natural appearance. Slope-based adds the low
  and mid tones. Its principle is somewhat different from that of
  Sigmoid and is similar to that of a TRC (the processing of the shadows
  not being strictly linear). The advantage of this algorithm is its
  simplicity; it enables effective treatment of the attenuation of
  highlights and also allows you to act on the overall contrast.
  - You also have the choice of ‘RGB channel Slope’, which is partly
    similar to RGB Curves, allowing differentiated action on the three
    R, G and B channels. Compared with Slope-based, a number of settings
    have been added to make full use of Freeman's algorithm:
    - Dynamic range (DR) is taken into account for the Viewing value of
      Yb % in addition to the Scene value,
    - Luminosity mode to try and preserve luminance (similar to RGB
      curves) - this mode can lead to strong artefacts,
    - Attenuation threshold associated with the ‘Highlight attenuation
      only’ choice to modulate the start of the action on highlights
      (normally from the Yb % Scene value).

In all 3 cases (Log Encoding, Sigmoid and the Freeman algorithm) we use
the Scene (source) data to make it fit into a useful range that is
consistent with our own visual capabilities and those of the peripheral
(screens, etc.). This useful range is also a source of debate: a) should
we use relative luminance for the output peripherals or absolute
luminance with the notions of Peak and ‘Diffuse white’ for luminance; b)
our eye-brain pairing has much better performance than any peripheral
and takes into account other physiological parameters (Ciecam). The
Cam16 (Selective Editing) module tries to take all these parameters into
account (as much as possible).

- The case of Sigmoid Q and Slope based Q: I wanted to integrate the 2
  Sigmoid and Slope based algorithms into Cam16's Q (Absolute luminance)
  loop (which has 6 variables). It's clear that we are no longer
  upstream of the process, but in the process. In particular, the Scene
  value of Yb% (middle grey) is profoundly modified by Ciecam. I've
  therefore applied an average empirical correction coefficient. These 2
  algorithms should be seen more as personal challenges than as real
  alternatives.

#### How do I use these tone-mapping algorithms?

- These tone-mapping algorithms can be described as semi-automatic,
  because the parameters used – Black Ev, White Ev and the Scene value
  of ‘Mean Luminance (Yb%)’ - are automatically pre-calculated. The
  values to be adjusted for Sigmoid or Slope-based are close to the
  default values.
- Log encoding can be used as a first step, and the TRC (using Gamma,
  Slope and Midtones) or even Sigmoid can be used as a complement.
- For the other cases (the majority), I recommend starting the process
  with TRC (gamma, slope, midtones) and attenuating the highlights
  either with ‘Ev- based’ or ‘Gamma-based’. If you want to increase the
  overall contrast you can activate ‘Slope-based’ or Sigmoid.

### Local Contrast

As I said earlier, I think it's better to use a moderate amount of
overall contrast to highlight the main subject (flowers, buildings,
animals, etc.) and then add some local contrast. This can take 2 forms:

- Either by using a guided-filter type algorithm (incorporated into
  Cam16) for small adjustments,
- Or by using variable local contrast using wavelets.
  - In the Abstract Profile module you have Contrast Enhancement based
    on the notion of contrast profiles.

<img src="/images/APwav.jpg" title="APwav.jpg" width="600" alt="APwav.jpg" />

- In Selective Editing, there is the Local Contrast & Wavelets tool,
  which in Basic mode allows you to adjust the local contrast (by
  choosing the appropriate range of decomposition levels) along with a
  Clarity function.
