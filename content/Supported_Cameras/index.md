RawTherapee supports most raw formats, including Pentax and Sony Pixel
Shift, Canon Dual-Pixel, and those from Foveon and X-Trans sensors. If
you're wondering whether it supports your camera's raw format, first
download RawTherapee and try for yourself. If a raw format is not
supported it will either not open, or the preview in the Editor tab will
appear black, white, or have a strong color cast - usually magenta. In
that case, read the [Adding Support for New Raw
Formats](Adding_Support_for_New_Raw_Formats.md) article.
