The Favorites Tab

</div>

## Favorites

This tab allows you to choose which tools appear in the Favorites tab of
the editor toolbox.

## Available Tools

Checkboxes indicate which tools and sub-tools are in the Favorites tab.
Only tools that can be marked as a favorite will have a checkbox.
Toggling a checkbox adds or removes the corresponding tool to/from the
Favorites tab.

## Favorites Panel

Favorite tools are listed here in the same order as they will appear in
the Favorites tab. Selecting a tool from the list and clicking the up or
down button located to the left of the list moves the tool up or down
the list. It is also possible to rearrange tools by dragging them. Tools
can be removed from favorites by selecting them and clicking the remove
button. Use the Ctrl key to select multiple tools or the Shift key to
perform a range selection.

## Options

- <b>Keep favorite tools in original locations</b>: If set, favorite
  tools will appear in both the favorites tab and their original tabs.
  Enabling this option may result in a slight delay when switching tabs.
