You can open raw images in GIMP using RawTherapee as a plugin.

## Requirements

- RawTherapee 5.3
- GIMP 2.9.6
- The RawTherapee executable must be found from the `$PATH` environment
  variable. This will be the case if you installed RawTherapee
  system-wide.

## Usage

Just open a raw file from GIMP. A RawTherapee editor window should open
automatically, which you can use to tweak your raw file. When you close
the window, the image gets imported into GIMP.
