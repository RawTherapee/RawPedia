Features

</div>

- Open-source, cross-platform.
- Easy camera-like starting point. By default, RawTherapee matches your
  raw photo to look like the out-of-camera JPEG photo. You can export
  as-is, or make further tweaks.
- RawTherapee uses
  [SSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions)
  optimizations for better performance on modern CPUs, and performs
  calculations in [floating point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point) precision.
- [Color management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_management)
  using the [LittleCMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LittleCMS) color
  management system.
- Supports DCP and [ICC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_profile)
  color profiles.
- Supports most raw formats, as well as floating-point HDR images in the
  DNG format. Also supports JPEG, TIFF and PNG.
- Support for [film negatives](film_negative) and
  [monochrome](demosaicing#monochrome_cameras) cameras.
- Queue your photos for later exporting, freeing up your CPU for working
  with the preview in a responsive way.
- [Rate](file_browser#rating) photos using a 0-5 star system
  (ratings are read from embedded Exif and XMP), tag them by color,
  filter by filename and metadata.
- Scroll the tool panels using your mouse scroll wheel without worrying
  about accidentally misadjusting any tools, or hold the Shift key while
  using the mouse scroll wheel to manipulate the adjuster the cursor is
  hovering over.
- Efficient use of vertical screen space by right-clicking on a tool to
  expand it while automatically collapsing all other tools.
- A Before\|After view to compare your latest change to any previous
  one.
- Lossless editing - all adjustments are stored in PP3 sidecar files.
- Dedicated command line support to automate RawTherapee using scripts
  or call it from other programs.
- Preserve, edit or strip metadata from exported images.
- Localized in over 15 languages.
- Adaptation of the [CIECAM02](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIECAM02)
  color appearance model ratified by the International Commission on
  Illumination (CIE) to maintain accurate colors and to, given a set of
  initial viewing condition parameters, convert the image so that it
  will look the same under the target viewing conditions.
- Profiled lens correction (vignetting, distortion, chromatic
  aberration) using Lensfun or Adobe Lens Correction Profiles (LCP).
- Dark frame subtraction and flat field correction to eliminate some
  forms of noise and sensor dust and correct vignetting and lens color
  casts.
