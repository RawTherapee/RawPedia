Windows

</div>

Follow the instructions on this page to compile RawTherapee on Windows
using the [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org) build environment. For more
details on customizing and understanding the build process, see the
[Linux](linux) article.

Note: this guide applies to compiling the **64-bit** version of
RawTherapee under **Windows 7 and newer**. Compiling the 32-bit version
is no longer supported, nor is compilation on older operating systems.
The latest version of RawTherapee to work under 32-bit Windows XP is
5.0-rc1, and can be downloaded
[here](http://www.rawtherapee.com/downloads/5.0-r1/) (dated 2017-02-02).

Note that RawTherapee also requires the availability of GTK+ 3.22.24 or
newer to have [native window support](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/issues/760#note_110809).
Without it RawTherapee may exhibit [strange behavior](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/issues/4125), such as
maximizing underneath the taskbar in Windows 10. When using an up to
date build environment, you should not encounter this problem.

## MSYS2 Installation

### Install MSYS2 base system

Install the build environment MSYS2 carefully by following the
instructions from the [MSYS2 website](https://www.msys2.org). Make sure
to update the system fully until no further updates are available, using
the command:

    $ pacman -Syu

MSYS2 provides [three 'shells'](https://www.msys2.org/wiki/MSYS2-introduction/) (command-line
interfaces) for different purposes: **MSYS**, **MinGW 32-bit** and
**MinGW 64-bit**. They can be launched through shortcuts in your Start
menu. Most commonly you will be running a 64-bit operating system and
will want to create applications that are optimized for that. Therefore,
start the **MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit** shell and continue below.

<figcaption><a href="File:MSYS2">File:MSYS2</a> Shell.jpg</figcaption>
</figure>

Note: in following text, <MSYS2> refers to the MSYS2 installation
folder, typically `C:\msys64`

### Install tools and libraries

MSYS2 uses the package manager `pacman` to install software and
components. Please refer to the [pacman
manual](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman) for details.

First, install a few miscellaneous tools:

    $ pacman -S tar gzip nano make diffutils intltool git

Then install the necessary development tools and the required libraries:

    $ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-gdb mingw-w64-x86_64-make mingw-w64-x86_64-pkg-config mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-ninja mingw-w64-x86_64-gtkmm3 mingw-w64-x86_64-lcms2 mingw-w64-x86_64-fftw mingw-w64-x86_64-exiv2 mingw-w64-x86_64-lensfun mingw-w64-x86_64-libiptcdata

### Updating Lensfun database

RawTherapee uses the [Lensfun](https://lensfun.github.io) library for
lens-specific corrections. Run the following command to update the
database:

    $ lensfun-update-data

The updater returns the path where the updated database is located.
**Copy this path for later use!**

### Download and build libiptcdata

Since December 2020 the `libiptcdata` library is provided by MSYS2 and
no longer requires manual compilation. <i>Only if you experience
problems using this library</i>, follow the instructions below to
manually build it. Otherwise, continue to the next section.

    $ cd ~
    $ curl -LO http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/libiptcdata/libiptcdata/1.0.4/libiptcdata-1.0.4.tar.gz
    $ tar xzf libiptcdata-1.0.4.tar.gz
    $ cd libiptcdata-1.0.4
    $ ./configure --prefix=/mingw64

Some modifications to the resulting `Makefile` are needed. You can edit
the file with any text editor (either through your OS or from within the
shell). We use the `nano` editor from within the shell:

    $ nano Makefile

    # search (command Ctrl+W)
    DIST_SUBDIRS = m4 libiptcdata po iptc docs win python
    # and replace with
    DIST_SUBDIRS = m4 libiptcdata po win python

    # search
    SUBDIRS = m4 libiptcdata po iptc docs win $(MAYBE_PYTHONLIB)
    # and replace with
    SUBDIRS = m4 libiptcdata po win $(MAYBE_PYTHONLIB)

    # save and quit
    Ctrl+X, Y

Finally build and install the library:

    $ make install

## Clone and build RawTherapee

### Clone RawTherapee's git repository.

RawTherapee's source code can be cloned from [the official GitHub
repository](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee):

    $ cd ~
    $ git clone git://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee.git
    $ cd RawTherapee

### Switching branches

After cloning you will automatically have checked out the `dev` branch.
This is the main development branch of RawTherapee and probably what you
want to use. To switch to a [different branch](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/branches), do the
following:

    $ git checkout branchname # replace with another available branch name

### Create a separate directory for the build

It is essential to create a new directory to build the application. The
directory can have any name, for example:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build

Note: if you switch branches, *always build in an empty directory* to
prevent issues. From within a build directory, you can run `rm -rf *` to
remove all files.

### Configuration and compilation

To create an optimized build for your machine architecture, use the
following commands:

    $ cmake -G "Ninja" -DLENSFUNDBDIR=put/your/lensfun/directory/here -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="release" -DWITH_SYSTEM_LIBRAW="ON" -DPROC_TARGET_NUMBER="2" -DCACHE_NAME_SUFFIX="5-dev" ..
    $ cmake --build . --target install

Make sure to replace the path to the Lensfun database with the actual
path obtained a few steps before. See the [Linux
article](Linux#CMake.md) for more details on the various
options. Depending on your system, the build process may take anywhere
between 5 and 25 minutes.

- JPEG XL read support depends on libjxl. By default, RawTherapee builds
  with JPEG XL support if and only if libjxl is present. Use
  -DWITH_JXL="ON" or DWITH_JXL="OFF" to explicitly enable or disable,
  respectively, JPEG XL support.
- RawTherapee builds with a custom version of LibRaw by default. To use
  the system LibRaw, use -DWITH_SYSTEM_LIBRAW="ON". Requires LibRaw \>=
  0.21.

There may be warnings during the build process which you can safely
ignore. Errors that are not traceable to a mistake when following this
guide should be reported
[here](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=).

### Starting RawTherapee

RawTherapee can now be run:

    $ ./release/rawtherapee.exe # replace release with debug or relwithdebinfo if you built another target

### Optional: preloaded CMake cache

As described in the [CMake
manual](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html)

    -C <initial-cache>

        Pre-load a script to populate the cache.

        When cmake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a CMakeCache.txt file and populates it with customizable settings for the project. This option may be used to specify a file from which to load cache entries before the first pass through the project’s cmake listfiles. The loaded entries take priority over the project’s default values. The given file should be a CMake script containing SET commands that use the CACHE option, not a cache-format file.

To simplify the invocation of CMake and be able to easily define Windows
specific options, a `win.cmake` template script is provided with the
sources. Copy it out of RawTherapee's source to avoid overwriting by
update for instance in `mywin.cmake`. Edit it to define or modify
options. To preload the cache, in the CMake command line:

    $ cmake -G "Ninja" -DLENSFUNDBDIR=share/lensfun -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="release" -DPROC_TARGET_NUMBER="2" -DCACHE_NAME_SUFFIX="5-dev" -C <path/to/mywin.cmake> ..

## Making a bundled build

This section only applies if you want to run RawTherapee outside the
MinGW shell or distribute it.

Note: You can copy either with the Windows file manager or, recommended,
with
[robocopy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/robocopy)
inside the `mingw64` shell script using `-` instead of `/` for the
options.

### Definition of folders

- <prefix> is <MSYS2>`\mingw64`,
- <MSYS2> is the MSYS2 installation folder,
- and `.` is the RawTherapee installation folder.

    [Settings] gtk-button-images=1

## Creating a distributable package

If you plan to distribute RawTherapee packages for the Windows platform,
as a first step you need to make sure that RawTherapee will be built for
the "generic" processor target. To do so, use `-DPROC_TARGET_NUMBER="1"`
in the CMake command.

During compilation, a script named `WindowsInnoSetup.iss` is created in
the RawTherapee installation folder. This script is used by Inno Setup
[1](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php), a program which is used to
generate installers for Windows programs. It is advised to download the
Unicode version
[2](http://www.jrsoftware.org/download.php/is-unicode.exe) to avoid
problems with some languages.

To help users [write useful bug reports](how_to_write_useful_bug_reports), package
maintainers are encouraged to produce builds which include both a
"release" and a "debug" executable, and to bundle them together with the
GDB debugger executable.

In other words, put the `rawtherapee.exe` (release) file together with
the `rawtherapee-debug.exe` (debug) file and the `gdb.exe` file together
into the same installer or the same archive. An alternative is to
produce "relwithdebinfo" builds - these are much faster than "debug" but
not as optimized as "release" builds, yet they provide just about as
much useful information as "debug" builds.

When making "relwithdebinfo" or "debug" builds you must provide the GDB
debugger executable. Windows binaries of the debugger `gdb.exe` can be
downloaded from
[here](http://www.equation.com/servlet/equation.cmd?fa=gdb) in 32- and
64-bit versions and will be copied into Rawtherapee installation folder.

Now that everything is set up, to create the package right-click on the
`WindowsInnoSetup.iss` script and choose *Compile* from the context
menu. It will automatically generate the installer and place it in the
parent folder.

To make your new package compatible with the RawTherapee website's
upload panel, create a zip archive in which you will place both the
newly created installer and the corresponding *AboutThisBuild.txt* file
which can be found at the same place. Name the resulting zip archive
following this template:
`RawTherapee_`<version>`_win64_`<buildtype>`.zip`

If you are building and distributing nightly builds, follow this
template: `RawTherapee_`<branch>`_`<version>`_win64_`<buildtype>`.zip`

- "win64" means it can run on 64-bit Windows (in effect, only Windows 7
  and newer is officially supported).
- The "version" will either look like `5.8` if you checkout the `5.8`
  tag, or <code>5.8-g35abd92

</code> if you checkout the `dev` branch after 5.8 was tagged.

- If you are shipping more than one build type in an installer, don't
  include <buildtype> in the name.
