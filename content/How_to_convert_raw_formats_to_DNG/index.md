Digital photography cameras can most often save your images in the
[JPEG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG) format, as well as dump the
raw values from each of the millions of photosites which make up a
sensor and store them, along with some
[metadata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata), in a proprietary raw
format. Some cameras also let you choose
[DNG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Negative) (Digital Negative)
as the raw format, which is an
[open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_format), lossless format
developed by Adobe. Unlike JPEG images, which are already "developed",
these raw files (both proprietary and DNG) contain raw data (ergo the
name "raw file" - do not capitalize it, it is not an acronym!) which
must first be processed before an image is obtained.

There are numerous benefits in converting your raw files to the DNG
format:

1.  It has universal support. You may be able to use your DNG images in
    programs which do not have support for your non-DNG raw format.
2.  It is not a dead format - it is constantly maintained.
3.  Adobe's DNG Converter includes color matrices and white levels in
    the converted DNG files - these are usually not present in non-DNG
    files, and Adobe's ones are often more accurate than those from
    dcraw. This leads to more accurate color and lowers the chance of
    color casts in clipped areas.
4.  DNG files are often smaller than your original raw files due to
    better lossless compression. The camera software is limited by its
    hardware - it must write the raw file as quickly as possible and not
    draw too much current, so compression is optimized for speed, not
    for file size. Computer software does not have this limitation.
5.  Even if your camera supports shooting straight to DNG, your camera's
    implementation of DNG is likely
    [outdated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Negative#Versions_of_the_specification).
    In some cases it may be warranted to re-convert your old DNGs to a
    newer DNG specification using the newest version of Adobe's DNG
    Converter. Possible reasons could be that the newer color matrices
    might be more accurate, lossless compression might be improved,
    improved support for defective pixel marking, inclusion of new
    opcodes, injection of new useful metadata tags, etc.

If you do convert your raw files to DNG, you should first test a few
sample DNG files to make sure everything in your workflow still
functions correctly before deleting the source files. Having said that,
issues with DNG are very rare, unlike the
[FUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt)
surrounding it which is in no hurry of dying down.

Adobe's DNG Converter is not the only program that converts raw files to
DNG. There are [DNGLab](https://github.com/dnglab/dnglab) and the
digiKam/kipi-plugins DNG Image Converter (which uses
[LibRaw](http://www.libraw.org/) and libkdcraw). Note that these
converters may use color matrices different to those from Adobe DNG
Converter.

Get the latest version of Adobe DNG Converter here:

- [Download Adobe DNG Converter](https://www.filehorse.com/download-adobe-dng-converter/old-versions/)
  (get the build for Windows if you're using Linux - installation is
  explained below).

Run it and you're done.

## Unsupported sensors

The DNG format can contain real raw data, but it can also contain
demosaiced images. These demosaiced images are no longer really raw -
they have been pre-cooked. While this is generally undesirable, there
are situations where we can take advantage of this possibility. Some
cameras have sensors with [color filter array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_filter_array) layouts and
sensor pixel layouts unsupported by RawTherapee. Though you cannot
directly process these raw files in RawTherapee, you can convert them to
demosaiced DNG files using the Adobe DNG Converter. As these demosaiced
DNG files are no longer truly raw, do not delete your original raw
files! This procedure is merely a workaround.

To convert raw files not currently supported by RawTherapee to
demosaiced DNG files, use the following settings:

- "Custom" compatibility mode using "DNG 1.4"
- "Linear (demosaiced)" must be ticked.

The resulting DNG files may end up being larger than the input files -
as an example, an input RAF file resulted in a DNG file 142% larger in
size.

These demosaiced DNG files can now be used in RawTherapee (or any other
DNG-supporting program), though as they are already demosaiced the tools
in the "Raw" tab will be disabled.



## Installing Adobe DNG Converter in Linux

We will be using `$HOME/wine-dng` as the Wine prefix.
